While it's nice to have some raw data in place, in its current state, it won't help us to answer our most burning questions.

So **how can we create business value** from our raw data and generate shiny **KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators), clean **metrics** and powerful **insights**?


## Let's start at the end

To answer this question, it might make sense to step some steps forward and start at the end. What do we want to achieve? What do we want to have in the end?

Most of the time, we aim to create a key indicator or a metric (*the naming here is a discussion on its own*), that helps us to answer a business question. 

Here are some examples:

- `Number of Pokemon, which donated in December`
- `Total amount of donations in December`
- `Average amount of donation per Pokemon`
