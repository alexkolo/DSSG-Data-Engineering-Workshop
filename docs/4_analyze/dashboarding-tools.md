# Analyze - 30min
This is the part where you get to play with the data. We will use a tool called Metabase to explore the data and answer some questions. This part is not our main focus as we assume that vizualizing data is not the main challenge for most of you as its your bread and butter already. What we want to show though, is how Dashboarding tools fit into the ecosystem we presented today and how they can be used to make data accessible to business people.

## Lowering the access barrier for business people

## How these tools fit into the bigger picture

Most Dashboarding tools work quite similar. They are a Front End to your Data Warehouse and most of the time come with a lot of connectors to connect to various Data Stores via SQL. Most of the companies and people behind those tools want to make money to some extend. While this is totally fine, it is important to understand that this is also the reason why a lot of those tools have so many features while you actually only need a small subset of them. 

!!! tip "What you need most of the tnote ime is the functionality to group line and bar charts in a dashboard and apply some dynamic filters on them."

    Of course a lot of it is nice to have. But often it also creates complexity that shields you away from answering the actual questions you have. 

## Considerations when using Dashboarding tools

A lot of the Tools like Metabase, Tableau, PowerBI come with a rich set of functionality to not only visualize data, but also create on the fly aggrations, join data etc. To be able to do so they will generate and execute SQL for you under the Hood. What sounds nice at first comes with a bunch of risks you should be aware of.

1. The SQL that is generated is quite hard to maintain and keeping a structure like the one you learned about in the DBT Session today is almost impossible to maintain.
2. The Dahboards itself are not versioned and it is hard to keep track of changes and who did what. So keeping the logic of the dashbaord as minimal as possible enables changing them easily later.


??? tip "Consider moving as much processing logic as possible into your SQL Transformations instead of introducing another layer in your vizualizing tool."

You will benefit a lot from this approach after a few months. And your future colleagues will thank you for it. 

## The Tool for today: Metabase

Metabase is a freemium open source. Tools There are tons of other tools out there. We just picked Metabase before we worked with it before, it has a SaaS offering, but also an open source version and it is quite easy to use.
