We know that half a day is a short time to get started with a potentially completely new topic. And we don't want to leave you alone with all the new things you learned today. So here are some pointers on where to go from here:

Depending on where you want to deepen your knowledge, we recommend you to take a look at the following resources:

## Exercices
We hope that you liked the Pokemon example we covered today. As you can imagine there are lots of things that we had no time to cover. So here are a few ideas for extending our data platform:

- Add a new source to Airbyte by direcly calling the Pokemon API. You can find the documentation [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). To have a quick walkthrough of how to add a new source to Airbyte, you can take a look at the [docs](https://docs.airbyte.io/tutorials/building-a-connector).
- Add more transformations in dbt. You might want to try out the new semantic layer that was introduced in the recent version of dbt.

- There are cool new tools for data visualization.

## Tools and Concepts
### dbt
If you are more of a reader, we recommend you to take a look at the [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/). They are very well written and provide a lot of information on how to use dbt.
