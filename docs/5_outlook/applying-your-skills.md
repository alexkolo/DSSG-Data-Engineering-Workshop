# Applying your new skills. A little FAQ

I hope you enjoyed the workshop and learned something new. Now it is time to apply your new skills. Assume you have a small organisation you want to help out. Here are a few things to consider when you want to help them to structure their data needs:

??? question "We have no access to cloud infrastructure. What can we do?"

    Running things on Cloud Infrastructure definetly makes some things easier but it is not a must have.
    We tried to cover the most relevant categories of tools that you will need to build a data stack that helps teams to get insights from their data.

    Most of the tools we covered today have a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering. 
    This means you can use them without having to worry about infrastructure. Actually this is what we would recommend you to use in most cases, as the majority of organisations do not have the resources to maintain their own infrastructure. 
    Summing up all cost you will most propably end up much cheaper or even for free compared to running things on e.g. AWS.

    So check the tools you like to use. DBT Cloud for example comes free with one seat. Other Tools might also have speical free tier offerings for non profits. If nothing is listed on their Website just hit the sales team with a message. There is a good chance that they will help you out.
