# The Pokemon Catastrope

Learning things is fun! But learning things is also hard. And sometimes it is even harder to learn things that you already know. And most potentially you already know a lot of the things we will talk about today to some extend. What is new today might be that we try to glue everything together to solve one common use case of data engineering. And we will do so while solving the problem of the Pokemon Catastrophe.


So lets start with what most work related things start with: **A Problem**. Honestly we do not care to much about Pokemon. But we do care about data engineering. And we want to learn about data. And luckily there is a lot of data about Pokemon. So lets use that data to learn about data engineering. And to make it a bit more interesting, we will not just learn about data engineering but we will also try to save a world. Unfortunately not our world. But the world of pokemons, because they just had a catastrophe. And we will try to help them to get back on their feet. 

**So lets hear a bit more about it** 

 Torrential rains and rising waters caused widespread destruction, submerging Pokémon habitats and leaving trainers and their Pokémon displaced. To overcome this hardship, Pokémon had to work together, utilizing their unique abilities and strengths to rebuild their houses and restore their communities. Water-type Pokémon helped clear debris and construct new structures, while other Pokémon with special abilities like electric or psychic powers aided in drying out the submerged areas and providing energy for the rebuilding process. This collaborative effort showcased the resilience and unity of the Pokémon, as they joined forces to heal their world and create a safer and stronger environment for all.
