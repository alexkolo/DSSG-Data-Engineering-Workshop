# Storing Data

As you might imagine, storing data in key in data disciplines, so there is no way around this today. You can store data in tons of ways and we do not need to explain you all as you are most likely familiar with lots of them. Today we will therefore focus on one data storing solution that we hope is a good start into data warehousing: [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

You might have heard of SQLite before. DuckDB is very similar to SQLite, but it is optimized for analytical queries. It is also very easy to use and you can run it on your laptop.

Think of DuckDB as a spreadsheet that is stored on your computer. You can run queries against it and you can also connect to it from other tools. We could also use Excel or Google Sheets for this, but DuckDB is a bit more powerful and it is also free and open source. The most relevant advantage for us is that we can run SQL queries against it. This will be very useful for us later on.

## Why SQL is great.
We know that you probably love your pandas. But today there will be no fluffy stuff for you. We will use SQL. SQL is the most widely used language for data analysis and it is also the most widely used language for data warehousing. It is a very powerful language and it is also very easy to learn. It is also very easy to use and you can run it on your laptop.
